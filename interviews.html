        <div class="qa">
          <p>
            <strong>Q1: Tell us about yourself</strong><br />
            A1: Hello Lumber Fan Group Community, I am Bentley formal
            Journalist, and Event Committee. I currently do QOTD, and I started
            Lt2 in 2017-2018. I saw the game and it looked appealing. With my
            Lumber Journey I played with friends, and I remembered the days
            staying up 24 hours a night just to grind. Now in 2025 I still play
            a little and am currently building the Cyber Series by Aptyn and
            Jab. But if you want to play or need help DM me!
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Q2: How did you come across LT2?</strong><br />
            A2: ERROR911 and CorrupedKey12 introduced me to the game, they were
            rich and one wanted to help me. Both of these boys are now in their
            20s and we all wish we weren't this old because the good times.
            Although, we still talk and laugh no more Roblox.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Q3: What's your favorite memory in LT2?</strong><br />
            A3: Favorite memory, mhm that's a hard one I would have to say that
            playing with ERROR911 and CorruptedKey12. But just the memory's we
            made laughing, chatting, and having fun. Unfortunately I have lost
            contact with them. They have deleted their account or something. But
            2 months ago we could talk but not no more. Hanging with
            cesargeronimo is fun too!! I love to hear what he has to say, always
            joking and having fun in his private server in Lt2. But it's fun
            when we just all hop in a VC Inkio, dawn, and many more come! They
            all have assisted in my online life in some way or another.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Q4: What's your biggest goal in LT2 and why?</strong><br />
            A4: My biggest goal is to just help players, I have always been
            negative in Fan Group and I want to change that. Trying to work my
            way back up slowly. But if you ever need help DM me or something and
            I would love to help you.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong
              >Q5: If LT2 would ever have a big update, what would you want to
              see added?</strong
            ><br />
            A5: If Lt2 had a BIG update I would want something as in a Map
            revamp. Defaultio is not ready for a new biome etc. but something
            small then we can go big. Everyone wants the game to advance but the
            game is more fun easy and classic style!
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Q6: What made you continue playing LT2?</strong><br />
            A6: Fan Group, if it wasn't for this server I would have left the
            game for life. A little motivation to finish my builds, make shops,
            and just chat in the community made me feel welcome and happy no
            matter what mood I was in. If I had a bad day I knew I could depend
            on FG because I trusted them most on my online world!
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Q7: Could you give advice for new LT2 players?</strong
            ><br />
            A7: Hold on to your builds, before they get massed dupe and make
            sure you impact those who impacted you. Don't give up, stress, or
            quit sometimes things can be hard but never giving up is the key to
            unlock your Lt2 success.
