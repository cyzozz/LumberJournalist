          <div class="qa">
            <p>
              <strong>Q1: Tell us about yourself</strong><br />
              A1: Hello Lumber Fan Group Community, I am Bentley, formal
              Journalist, and Event Committee. I currently do QOTD, and I
              started LT2 in 2017-2018. I played with friends and stayed up 24
              hours a night just to grind. Now in 2025 I still play a little and
              am currently building the Cyber Series by Aptyn and Jab. DM me if
              you want to play or need help!
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q2: How did you come across LT2?</strong><br />
              A2: ERROR911 and CorrupedKey12 introduced me to the game. We all
              still talk sometimes, even though a lot has changed over the
              years.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q3: What's your favorite memory in LT2?</strong><br />
              A3: Playing with friends, laughing, chatting, and having fun. Even
              though I lost contact with some players, hanging with others in
              VCs is still fun!
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q4: What's your biggest goal in LT2 and why?</strong
              ><br />
              A4: To help players and change my previous negative approach in
              the Fan Group. I want to support the community.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong
                >Q5: If LT2 had a big update, what would you want to
                see?</strong
              ><br />
              A5: A map revamp, maybe small at first. Everyone wants the game to
              evolve, but keeping classic style fun is key.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q6: What made you continue playing LT2?</strong><br />
              A6: Fan Group. The community motivates me to keep building,
              chatting, and enjoying the game.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q7: Advice for new LT2 players?</strong><br />
              A7: Don't give up, hold onto your builds, and impact those who
              impacted you. Persistence is key!
            </p>
