          <h3>Wiki Fact of the Week — Plain Bag of Candy Edition!</h3>
          <p>
            The <strong>Plain Bag of Candy</strong> released in the Halloween
            event of 2025, costing 3,674 LumberBucks at Wood R Us. It has a
            brown box following the design of previous candy bags, and includes
            a unique sound of faint laughter when opened! The bag, made by
            ElectroTech and Aptyn, includes 9 unique candy bars — one of which
            is rare and white. This rare candy gives the player a white glow
            when eaten.
          </p>
          <p>
            Description: <em>"Pretty sure... its CANDY!!! YAAAAAAY!!!!"</em>
