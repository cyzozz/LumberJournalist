          <h3>Lumber News #167 — Weekly Recap!</h3>
          <p>
            Hey there! Good to see you back for the news this week. We hope that
            you enjoy! (Sorry for being a day late)

          <h3>Bob the Builder role</h3>

          <p>
            There's a new amazing role that was added just recently, on the 27th
            of October. The server has introduced the Bob the Builder role! The
            role is awarded to people that show at least a moderate skill in a
            real-life craft or trade. This role was inspired by @Bob the
            Builder, and was suggested by AzChick. The staff team noticed Bobby
            the Dinosaur's creation, a pinball machine, and decided to add the
            Bob the Builder role. He was also given the Bob the Builder
            nickname, along with the role before it was announced and available
            for the community. Since the role was added, the following community
            members have received it: @The Actual DJ, @furgo my feggo | Koioxi |
            ST, @HTTT4132, @Chiaroscuro (i_loveu899), @bullterrier2, and
            @Kin_Animates2 Let’s all congratulate them for showcasing their
            creativity and craftsmanship not only in Lumber Tycoon 2, but in
            real life as well! More information about this role can be found at
            ⁠LT2 Fan Group Discord⁠.

          <h3>Wiki Fact of the Week — Cherry Pie Edition!</h3>
          <p>
            The Cherry Pie was an item added to Lumber Tycoon 2 in the 2024
            Thanksgiving event, being sold at Fancy Furnishings for $3,141. The
            item has a light brown outer color, with a red inner color,
            representing a cherry-filled pie, although players can burn the pie
            in a volcano to make the crust and inside much darker. The pie has a
            similar design to previous pies, although it has a diamond lattice
            pattern with visible filling, unlike the Apple or Pumpkin Pies. The
            item was created by RandomFlowz,
